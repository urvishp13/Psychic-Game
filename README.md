# Psychic Game

This game involves 2 people: the Player and the Computer. The Player has to guess the letter the Computer has chosen. If the Player guesses the Computer's letter correctly, he wins. The Player only gets a certain amount of guesses to guess the Computer's letter. If he uses all the guesses provided to him, he loses, and a new game is started with the initial number of guesses restored.

The number of guesses the Player has can be changed in the [index.html](https://github.com/urvishp13/Psychic-Game/blob/main/index.html) file in the `<span id="guesses-left">` element; simply change the number.

The Psychic Game is a Week 2 project of the Fall 2018 Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program redone in 2022.
